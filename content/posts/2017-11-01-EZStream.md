EZStream is the easiest way to stream your device camera in any web browser. Tap on the screen to toggle your IP address and put that address in your browser.

Et Voila.

A red dot in the upper right corner of EZStream indicates that someone is watching your stream.Beware, this only works on a local network.

It is an application I've made a long time ago when I was trying to learn Swift and iOS development. &nbsp;I would probably do it differently now :-)

If anyone is interested, here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/twittemb/StreamIt). The major challenge was to make a MJPEG stream and a web server on the device.
