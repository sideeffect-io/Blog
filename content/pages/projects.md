* [AsyncExtensions](https://github.com/sideeffect-io/AsyncExtensions) aims to mimic Swift Combine operators for async sequences.
* [AsyncStateMachine](https://github.com/sideeffect-io/AsyncStateMachine) aims to provide a way to structure an application thanks to state machines. The goal is to identify the states and the side effects involved in each feature and to model them in a consistent and scalable way. 
* [Feedbacks](https://github.com/CombineCommunity/Feedbacks) is a tool to build feedback loops within a Swift based application. Feedbacks relies on DSL written state machines and Apple's Combine. It is compatible with SwiftUI and UIKit.
* [RxFlow](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxFlow) is a navigation framework for iOS applications based on a Reactive Flow Coordinator pattern.
* [Spin](https://github.com/Spinners/Spin.Swift) is a tool to build feedback loops within a Swift based application allowing you to use a unified syntax whatever the underlying reactive programming framework and whatever Apple UI technology you use (RxSwift, ReactiveSwift, Combine and UIKit, AppKit, SwiftUI).
* [Swift Async Algorithms](https://github.com/apple/swift-async-algorithms) aims to provide operators to `AsyncSequence` that are not in the standard library.
