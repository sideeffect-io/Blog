Here's a list of Open Source projects I contribute to on a regular basis:

# AsyncExtensions

* Summary: `AsyncExtensions` aims to mimic Swift Combine operators for async sequences.
* GitHub: https://github.com/sideeffect-io/AsyncExtensions

# AsyncStateMachine

* Summary: `AsyncStateMachine` aims to provide a way to structure an application thanks to state machines. The goal is to identify the states and the side effects involved in each feature and to model them in a consistent and scalable way.
* GitHub: https://github.com/sideeffect-io/AsyncStateMachine

# Swift Async Algorithms

* Summary: `swift-async-algorithms` is an Apple repo that aims to bring operators to `AsyncSequence` that are not included in the standard library.
* GitHub: https://github.com/apple/swift-async-algorithms

# Feedbacks

* Summary: `Feedbacks` is a tool to build feedback loops within a Swift based application. Feedbacks relies on DSL written state machines and Apple's Combine. It is compatible with SwiftUI and UIKit.
* GitHub: https://github.com/CombineCommunity/Feedbacks

# Spin

* Summary: `Spin` is a tool to build feedback loops within a Swift based application allowing you to use a unified syntax whatever the underlying reactive programming framework and whatever Apple UI technology you use (RxSwift, ReactiveSwift, Combine and UIKit, AppKit, SwiftUI).
* GitHub: https://github.com/Spinners/Spin.Swift

# RxFlow

* Summary: `RxFlow` is a navigation framework for iOS applications based on a Reactive Flow Coordinator pattern.
* GitHub: https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxFlow
